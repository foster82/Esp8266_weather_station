# Esp8266_weather_station

This is the my code for my weather station made from a esp8266, DHT11 and a BMP180.

Now this is my first real project so my code is a little messy and my commenting is a little poor at this stage.

Please feel free to let me know if you have any ideas on how to inprove my code. I will also be eventualy uploading diagrams of my setup.
Please also feel free to add any ideas as to how i can improve the overall weatherstation. This also currently uploads to thingspeak.
